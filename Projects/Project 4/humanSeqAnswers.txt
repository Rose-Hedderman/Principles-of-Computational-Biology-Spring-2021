0) A positive D-statistic is an abundance of ABBA correlations and implies backcrossing between adjacent populations (the B to B relation in ABBA). A negative D-statistic is an abundance of BABA correlations and implies backcrossing between non-adjacent populations (the B to B relation in BABA where there is an A in the middle.
1) There has been admixture between Neanderthals and Denisovans and the Mbuti and Yoruba, Dai and British, and Dai and Yoruba groups of
Anatomically Modern Humans.  There were significant differences between the members in each population pair. This was determined because their z-scores were below an absolute value of 3.
2) This does not mean that there is no archaic admixture into modern African populations. This means that there is limited admixture from these populations. The biases from not having any archaic genomes from Africa include having the model point towards a biased conclusion. This model does not sample every population, but only those tested therefore conclusions can only be made about the populations in the dataset. Populations not in the dataset, such as archaic African genomes, should not draw a conclusion.
